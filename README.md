# Code Challenges

A mono repo containing all the code challenges I created for the AND Digital dev community.

You can find all the previous challenges in the `Challenges` folder as well as my solutions for each challenge in the `Solutions` folder.

Feel free to fork the repo and have a go at the challenges, suggest improvements to existing challenges, or even add your own.
